Hi,

\vskip1cm

We welcome you to the 4th annual Latin American Conference on Scientific Computing with Python.
This year we will be hosting one Software Carpentry workshop for beginners,
12 tutorials, 16 talks, 80 minutes for lightning talks
and some social events.

The conference will start on Monday with 2 days of tutorials and workshops, followed by three days of talks and lightning talks. Lightning talks will let presenters briefly show their projects so as to have the remaining three days to further discuss with interested participants.
Over the course of these five days we encourage you to participate on the scavenger hunt
and try to win its prize.

We hope that you enjoy your time in Florianópolis.
The Island of Santa Catarina has 42 beaches
and in the case you don't like beaches there are two lagoons and plenty of hiking places to discover.
Also worth visiting are the Public Market and the Fortress of São José da Ponta Grossa.

Have a nice conference and hope to see you again next year!
