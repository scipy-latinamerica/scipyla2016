## Why not cover all costs?

Our budget is very limited
so we can't provide many full financial aids.

And as any open source project we expect
that people contribute back to the project/community
and provide full financial aids will not help.

## Special Case Aids

specially the scientific computation with Python.
What goes into this category?

    (e.g. promoting workshops, hack hours, blogging, ...).
-   Help increase diversity
    (e.g. collaborate with IEEE WiSE).
